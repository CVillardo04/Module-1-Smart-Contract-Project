# Module-1-Smart-Contract-Project


SmartContractChester is a simple smart contract written in Solidity that allows for the storage, modification, and validation of a single unsigned integer value (storedData). The contract ensures that the value of storedData is always within a specified range (greater than 0 and less than 2000).

# description
