# Module-1-Smart-Contract-Project


  Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms.It's used to create smart contracts that implement business logic and generate a chain of transaction records in the blockchain system.

# description 

  Smart contracts are code written into a blockchain that executes the terms of an agreement or contract from outside the chain.It automates the actions that would otherwise be completed by the parties in the agreement, which removes the need for both parties to trust each other.
